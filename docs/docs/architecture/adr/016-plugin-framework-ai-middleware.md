- **Status:** Implemented
- **Date:** 2025-01-19
- **Deciders:** Mihai Criveti, Teryl Taylor
- **Technical Story:** [#313](https://github.com/anthropics/mcp-context-forge/issues/313), [#319](https://github.com/anthropics/mcp-context-forge/issues/319), [#673](https://github.com/anthropics/mcp-context-forge/issues/673)

## Context

The MCP Gateway required a robust plugin framework to support AI safety middleware, security processing, and extensible gateway capabilities. The implementation needed to support both self-contained plugins (running in-process) and external middleware service integrations while maintaining performance, security, and operational simplicity.

## Decision

We implemented a comprehensive plugin framework with the following key architectural decisions:

### 1. Plugin Architecture Pattern: **Hybrid Self-Contained + External Service Support**

**Decision:** Support both self-contained plugins and external service integration within a unified framework.

```python
class Plugin:
    """Base plugin for self-contained, in-process plugins"""
    async def prompt_pre_fetch(self, payload, context) -> PluginResult:
        # In-process business logic
        pass

class ExternalServicePlugin(Plugin):
    """Extension for plugins that integrate with external microservices"""
    async def call_external_service(self, payload) -> Any:
        # HTTP calls to AI safety services, etc.
        pass
```

**Rationale:**
- **Self-contained plugins** provide high performance for simple transformations (regex, basic validation)
- **External service integration** enables sophisticated AI middleware (LlamaGuard, OpenAI Moderation)
- **Unified interface** simplifies plugin development and management
- **Operational flexibility** allows mixing approaches based on requirements

### 2. Hook System: **Comprehensive Pre/Post Processing Points**

**Decision:** Implement 6 primary hook points covering the complete MCP request/response lifecycle:

```python
class HookType(str, Enum):
    PROMPT_PRE_FETCH = "prompt_pre_fetch"     # Before prompt retrieval
    PROMPT_POST_FETCH = "prompt_post_fetch"   # After prompt rendering
    TOOL_PRE_INVOKE = "tool_pre_invoke"       # Before tool execution
    TOOL_POST_INVOKE = "tool_post_invoke"     # After tool execution
    RESOURCE_PRE_FETCH = "resource_pre_fetch" # Before resource fetch
    RESOURCE_POST_FETCH = "resource_post_fetch" # After resource fetch
```

**Rationale:**
- **Complete coverage** of MCP request lifecycle enables comprehensive AI safety
- **Pre/post pattern** supports both input validation and output sanitization
- **Resource hooks** enable content filtering and security scanning
- **Extensible design** allows future hook additions (auth, federation, etc.)

### 3. Plugin Execution Model: **Sequential with Conditional Logic**

**Decision:** Execute plugins sequentially by priority with sophisticated conditional execution:

```python
class PluginExecutor:
    async def execute(self, plugins, payload, global_context, ...):
        for plugin in sorted_plugins_by_priority:
            # Check conditions (server_ids, tools, tenants, etc.)
            if plugin.conditions and not matches_conditions(...):
                continue

            result = await execute_with_timeout(plugin, ...)
            if not result.continue_processing:
                if plugin.mode == PluginMode.ENFORCE:
                    return block_request(result.violation)
                elif plugin.mode == PluginMode.PERMISSIVE:
                    log_warning_and_continue()
```

**Rationale:**
- **Sequential execution** provides predictable behavior and easier debugging
- **Priority-based ordering** ensures security plugins run before transformers
- **Conditional execution** enables fine-grained plugin targeting by context
- **Multi-mode support** (enforce/permissive/disabled) enables flexible deployment

### 4. Configuration Strategy: **File-Based with Database Extension Path**

**Decision:** Primary file-based configuration with structured validation and future database support:

```yaml
# plugins/config.yaml
plugins:
  - name: "PIIFilterPlugin"
    kind: "plugins.pii_filter.pii_filter.PIIFilterPlugin"
    hooks: ["prompt_pre_fetch", "tool_pre_invoke"]
    mode: "enforce"  # enforce | permissive | disabled
    priority: 50     # Lower = higher priority
    conditions:
      - server_ids: ["prod-server"]
        tools: ["sensitive-tool"]
    config:
      detect_ssn: true
      mask_strategy: "partial"
```

**Rationale:**
- **File-based configuration** supports GitOps workflows and version control
- **Structured validation** with Pydantic ensures configuration correctness
- **Hierarchical conditions** enable precise plugin targeting
- **Plugin-specific config** sections support complex plugin parameters

### 5. Security & Isolation Model: **Process Isolation with Resource Limits**

**Decision:** In-process execution with comprehensive timeout and resource protection:

```python
class PluginExecutor:
    async def _execute_with_timeout(self, plugin, ...):
        return await asyncio.wait_for(
            plugin_execution,
            timeout=self.timeout  # Default 30s
        )

    def _validate_payload_size(self, payload):
        if payload_size > MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE:  # 1MB limit
            raise PayloadSizeError(...)
```

**Rationale:**
- **Timeout protection** prevents plugin hangs from affecting gateway
- **Payload size limits** prevent memory exhaustion attacks
- **Error isolation** ensures plugin failures don't crash the gateway
- **Audit logging** tracks all plugin executions and violations

### 6. Context Management: **Request-Scoped with Automatic Cleanup**

**Decision:** Sophisticated context management with automatic lifecycle handling:

```python
class PluginContext(GlobalContext):
    state: dict[str, Any] = {}      # Cross-plugin shared state
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = {}   # Plugin execution metadata

class PluginManager:
    _context_store: Dict[str, Tuple[PluginContextTable, float]] = {}

    async def _cleanup_old_contexts(self):
        # Remove contexts older than CONTEXT_MAX_AGE (1 hour)
        expired = [k for k, (_, ts) in self._context_store.items()
                  if time.time() - ts > CONTEXT_MAX_AGE]
```

**Rationale:**
- **Request-scoped contexts** enable plugins to share state within a request
- **Automatic cleanup** prevents memory leaks in long-running deployments
- **Global context sharing** provides request metadata (user, tenant, server)
- **Local plugin contexts** enable stateful processing across hook pairs

### 3. **Embedded JavaScript/Lua Engine**
**Rejected:** Scripting engines would have enabled dynamic plugin logic but introduced security risks and performance unpredictability.
